## Problem 3
If the grader is familiar with GNU-make then simply navigate the command line to the "code" folder and type "make" after deleting the output folder.
This will automatically run all of the code for the problem and produce the output files that you need to review. 
This will compile the code and run the executable. The executable will then produce the output files in the "output" folder.
If you are not familiar with make, then simply manually create a folder called "output" and then run the code on the command line with the following command: "julia script.jl". 
This will produce the output files in the "output" folder.
This is my default workflow for all things coding, and I don't want to practice bad habits by using a different workflow for this course.
